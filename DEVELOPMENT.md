This project has three primary branches it uses: master (stable), dev (testing but stable), and sid (considered unstable and experimental). Releases under master will be submitted to the ports tree under `sysutils/chyves`, dev versions released under `sysutils/chyves-devel`, and sid will remain on GitHub.
