Bug reports are the life blood of this project. Bug reports are a great source of feedback as it indicates “we are doing it wrong”. Providing the necessary details are essential to finding and addressing bugs. There is no such thing as too many details when it comes to bug reports. There is a function `chyves debug` that will provide most of the details needed to address most issues when accompanied with a story. The output of `chyves debug` is pre-formatted in [markdown](http://whatismarkdown.com/) for GitHub.

Please submit open an issue here on our GitHub page.
