# chyves v0.0.0:

bhyve front end manager using ZFS to store guest data and parameters.

`chyves` enters the market of bhyve front end manager tools. It follows the lead set by `iocage` of using ZFS properties to store guest parameters and is a direct descendent of `iohyve`.

chyves utilizes FreeBSDâ€™s bhyve to start and manage type 2 virtualized guests. This is akin to VirtualBox and KVM. Currently bhyve only provides a serial interface to it's guests, however work is being done to add VNC support via UEFI GOP support. `chyves` attempts to bridge the high entry point of bhyve to a level most technical beginners can use.

The goal of this project is to provide a bhyve front end tool that is easy to use, develop, and debug. This project has a different structure and some differing goals than `iohyve`. For the time being, best effort is given to provide upstream bug fixes to their project as a gratitude for the leg up on this project's start.

`chyves` has also developed a series of tools at `chyves/chyves-utils` to import supported virtual guests from other platforms. This currently includes `iohyve` and snapshotless ESXi guests. Converting from other platforms should be possible if interest is expressed. `chyves-utils` is developed as a separate project as it requires dependancies with VirtualBox for the conversion of disk images.

`chyves` is primary tested on FreeBSD 10.3, however some resources go into testing FreeNAS 9.10 as well.
