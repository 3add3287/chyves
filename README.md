`chyves` enters the market of bhyve front end manager tools. `chyves` follows the lead set by `iocage` by using ZFS properties to store guest parameters and data. `chyves` is a direct code descendent of `iohyve` but a nearly complete code rewrite was done in April and May of 2016. Check the CHANGELOG.md to see the initial deviation from the project.

The goal of this project is to provide a bhyve front end tool that is easy to use, develop for, and debug. `chyves` is developed for an out of the box experience suited for the most basic of users. However power users will find that much can be tweaked and configured. There are also many features targeted for large VM fleets as well.

chyves utilizes FreeBSDâ€™s bhyve hypervisor to start and manage type 2 virtualized guests. This is akin to VirtualBox and KVM. Currently bhyve's only interface to guests is a serial interface.

`chyves` has also developed a series of tools at `chyves/chyves-utils`. One of the utilities imports supported virtual guests from other platforms. This currently includes `iohyve` and snapshotless ESXi guests. Converting from other platforms should be possible if interest is expressed. `chyves-utils` is developed as a separate project as it requires dependancies with VirtualBox for the conversion of disk images, many users would find a dependency on VirtualBox unacceptable.

`chyves` is primary tested on FreeBSD 10.3, however some resources go into testing FreeNAS 9.10 as well.
