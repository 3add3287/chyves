`chyves` is a bhyve front end manager using ZFS to store guest data and parameters.

`chyves` enters the market of bhyve front end manager tools. `chyves` follows the lead set by `iocage` by using ZFS properties to store guest parameters and data. `chyves` is a direct code descendent of `iohyve`. This project has a different structure and some differing goals than `iohyve`. For the time being, best effort is given to provide upstream bug fixes to the `iohyve` project as gratitude for the leg up on this project's start.

The goal of this project is to provide a bhyve front end tool that is easy to use, develop for, and debug.

chyves utilizes FreeBSDâ€™s bhyve hypervisor to start and manage type 2 virtualized guests. This is akin to VirtualBox and KVM. Currently bhyve's only interface to guests is a serial interface. `chyves` attempts to bridge the high entry point of bhyve to a level most technical beginners can use.

`chyves` has also developed a series of tools at `chyves/chyves-utils`. One of the utilities imports supported virtual guests from other platforms. This currently includes `iohyve` and snapshotless ESXi guests. Converting from other platforms should be possible if interest is expressed. `chyves-utils` is developed as a separate project as it requires dependancies with VirtualBox for the conversion of disk images, many users would find a dependency on VirtualBox unacceptable.

`chyves` is primary tested on FreeBSD 10.3, however some resources go into testing FreeNAS 9.10 as well.
